* The lectures will be done in the main Zoom room. 
* Most modules will have hands-ons. These are done in the main Zoom room, but with the possibility to go to break-out rooms for help.
<!--* Each break-out room will have one instructor assigned.-->
* Some hands-ons will be done locally on your own computer and some will be done using GitHub. 
* If there is a problem using your own computer, the backup solution is logging in to Kebnekaise and using that.

* During the hands-ons you can just ask the instructors if there is anything you need help with. 
* You can ask in the chat, but the recommended option is using the Google docs file for Questions and Answers (Q&A). The link can be found on the "Important information" page. Please write any questions you have during the lectures etc. to the Q&A page. The instructors will try to answer as quickly as possible. 
* Scroll down on a slide page to get to access the slides in a text form (small pen icon)
