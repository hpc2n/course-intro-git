* During the hands-ons you can just ask the instructors if there is anything you need help with. 
* You can ask in the chat, but the recommended option is using the Questions and Answers page (Q&A page). The link can be found on the "Important information" page. Please write any questions you have during the lectures etc. to the Q&A page. The instructors will try to answer as quickly as possible. 
* Scroll down on a slide page to get to access the slides in a text form (small pen icon)
