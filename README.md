# Materials for the participants of the course "Introduction to Git"

This repository contains the material for (most of) the exercises for the participants of the course "Introduction to Git" as well as the lectures.

The exercises are in the file 'git_materials.zip'. 

The lectures are in the folder 'Lectures'. There are two subfolders in that directory, one for the lectures in markdown language and one for them as PDF files. 

The course website, which also has the course schedule, can be found here: https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/events/courses/2021/git
