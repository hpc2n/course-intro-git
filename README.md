# Materials for the participants of the course "Introduction to Git" (November 2024) 

This repository contains the material for the exercises for the participants of the course "Introduction to Git" as well as copies of the lectures. 

**NOTE** Ignore the subdirectory **docs** for now, as well as the file **mkdocs.yml** - the course is in the process of being moved to GitHub pages instead of HackMD. 

## Exercises

The exercises are in the top-level file 'git_materials.zip'. 

When you have cloned the repository (click the green "Code" button to get the repo-url - pick the https one), unzip it. 

Clone the repository with 

`git clone https://github.com/hpc2n/course-intro-git.git`

Then cd into the directory that was created and do 

`unzip git_materials.zip` (on Linux systems) 

Then cd to the folder that is created. The exercises will be found under each subdirectory for the relevant lecture - in some cases just in a README.md file. 

**NOTE**: There is a subdirectory in this directory called 'exercises-solutions', it contains model solutions to (some of) the exercises. 

## Lectures 

The lectures are in the folder 'Lectures'.  

You can also find the lectures, probably in a nicer format, on the HackMD page for this course: [https://hackmd.io/@git-fall-2024](https://hackmd.io/@git-fall-2024)
Note that there may be minor updates which are only on the HackMD pages. 

## Other materials

The recordings of the lectures can be found on [HPC2N's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/HPC2N). There will be a playlist for the course. The recordings are usually uploaded within a day or so of the lecture.
