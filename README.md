# Materials for the participants of the course "Introduction to Git"

This repository contains the material for the exercises for the participants of the course "Introduction to Git" as well as copies of the lectures.

## Exercises

The exercises are in the file 'git_materials.zip'. 

When you have cloned the repository (click the green "Code" button to get the repo-url - pick the https one), unzip it. 

Clone it with 

`git clone repo-url`

Then do 

`unzip git_materials.zip` (on Linux systems) 

Then cd to the folder that is created. The exercises will be found under each subdirectory for the relevant lecture - in some cases just in a README.md file. 

**NOTE**: There is a subdirectory in this directory called 'exercises-readmes', it contains the readme files from the exercises so you can view them in a nicer format. The directory does NOT contain all the material for the exercises. Those are found in the git_materials.zip file. 

**NOTE 2**: There is a subdirectory in this directory called 'exercises-solutions', it contains model solutions to (some of) the exercises.
