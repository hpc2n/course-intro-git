# What is version control?

---

In software engineering, version control (also known as revision control, source control, or source code management) is a class of systems responsible for __managing changes__ to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information.

## Why use version control?

---

In an ideal world, things develop linearly: 

- Every new version is an improvement upon the previous version. 
    - No need to backtrack. 
- Everyone knows what everyone else is doing 
- In the end, things are simply finished.

In the real world, things develop non-linearly: 

- A new version can be anything between 
    - a complete catastrophe and 
    - a major breakthrough.
- People do not know what others are doing 
- Sometimes we are simply fixing earlier mistakes... 

```graphviz
digraph {
  rankdir=LR
  Mon[label="Monday's\n improvements"] [fixedsize=circle]
  Tue[label="Tuesday's\n mistakes"] [fixedsize=circle]
  Wed[label="Wednesday's\n corrections"] [fixedsize=circle]
  Mon -> Tue
  Tue -> Wed
}
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

---

### Going back to an earlier version

Sometimes, it is easier to simply backtrack to an *earlier version*...

```graphviz
digraph {
  rankdir=LR
  Mon[label="Monday's\n improvements"] [fixedsize=circle]
  Tue[label="Tuesday's\n mistakes"] [fixedsize=circle]
  Wed[label="Wednesday's\n improvements"] [fixedsize=circle]
  Mon -> Tue
  Mon -> Wed
}
```

---

#### Where is this *earlier version*?

 - CTRL + Z <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - my_file.txt, my_file.txt.old, ... <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - My project/ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - 2020-08-12/
     - 2020-08-13/
     - ...
 - Daily home directory backup <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

#### Challenges and obstacles

 - Prone to mistakes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - CTRL + Z has limits, overwritten/deleted files, human/hardware error <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - How much to save? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Individual files? Everything? How much space is required? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - How to organize versions? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - What is the difference between different versions? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*Overall, difficult to manage!* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

#### What about the granularity?

```graphviz
digraph {
  rankdir=LR

  subgraph cluster1 {
    t1a [label="Component A\n improvement"] [fixedsize=circle]
    t1b [label="Component B\n mistake"] [fixedsize=circle]
    t1c [label="Component C\n improvement"] [fixedsize=circle]
    label="Mondays's changes"
  }

  subgraph cluster2 {
    t2a [label="Component A\n improvement"] [fixedsize=circle]
    t2b [label="Component B\n correction"] [fixedsize=circle]
    t2c [label="Component C\n mistake"] [fixedsize=circle]
    label="Tuesday's changes"
  }

  subgraph cluster3 {
    t3a [label="Component A\n mistake"] [fixedsize=circle]
    t3b [label="Component B\n improvement"] [fixedsize=circle]
    t3c [label="Component C\n correction"] [fixedsize=circle]
    label="Wednesday's changes"
  }
  
  t1a -> t2a
  t1b -> t2b
  t1c -> t2c

  t2a -> t3a
  t2b -> t3b
  t2c -> t3c
}
```

*This compounds the problems!*

---

#### How does VCS solve this?

 - Stores the history using snapshots (commits) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Each snapshot represents the project at a given point in time <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Manages snapshots and associated metadata <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Naming (tags), comments, dates, authors, etc <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Easy to move between different snapshots <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Can handle different degrees of granularity <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Can handle multiple development paths (branches) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Comparing and joining

 - VCS makes it easy to compare different snapshots <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Named revisions, comments, time information, author information <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Diff tools <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Search tools <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Bisection search <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - VCS also allows the joining (merging) of different snapshots  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Easy to experiment with ideas <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Collaboration

 - One of the primary functions of VCS is to allow collaboration <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Usual setup: server (remote) + multiple clients <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - People work locally and send (push) the changes to the server <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - VCS keeps track of what has been done and by whom <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Safer since mistakes can be easily remedied <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - The contributions of several people can be merged <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Backup

 - VCS functions as a backup <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Locally, the system maintains a copy of each file <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Usually only the changes or the files that have changed are stored <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Globally, lost files can be recovered from the server <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Integration

 - VCSs such as Git have been integrated with several services <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - HackMD, Overleaf, ...
 - Services such as GitHub can do almost everything for you <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Store history, distribute, testing / continuous integration, bug reports, milestones, website, ... <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Summing up

Version control systems

- keeps track of your files and other output
- tracks what is created and modified
- tracks who made the modifications
- tracks why the modifications were made (if you make good commit comments)

---

## Practical use cases

What are the practical use cases for VCS?

---

### Source code

 - Many VCSs are designed for managing source code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Manage deployment (production, development, testing, etc) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Manage published versions (v0.1 etc) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Manage (experimental) features <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Bug hunting <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - But also for: writers, artists, composers... <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Latex files

 - Track which version of a manuscript has been <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - submitted, 
     - revised and/or 
     - accepted
 - Collaboration between several authors <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### HPC: batch files and data

 - Track different versions of your batch scripts <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Easy to check the used configuration afterwards
 - Track input and output files <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
     - Limited to smallish files

---

### Examples of VCS

<!-- .slide: style="font-size: 24px;" -->

- SCCS: The first VCS. Created in 1972 at Bell Labs. Was available only for UNIX and worked with Source Code files only.
- RCS (Revision Control System): First release July 1985. Usually superseded by other systems such as CVS, which began as a wrapper on top of RCS. 
- CVS (centralized version control system): First release July 1986; based on RCS. Expands on RCS by adding support for repository-level change tracking, and a client-server model. 
- Apache Subversion (SVN): First release in 2004 by CVS developers with the goal of replacing CVS. 
- BitKeeper: Initial release May 2000. Distributed version control. Was shortly used for developing the Linux kernel. Proprietary. No longer maintained.
- **Git**: Started by Linus Torvalds in April 2005, originally for developing the Linux kernel. Distributed version control. Open source.
