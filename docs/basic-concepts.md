# Lecture 3: Basic concepts 

---

## Remark

- You are **not** intended to memorize any commands or low-level details. 
- The goal is to learn the *basic concepts*: 
    - hash sums, blobs, trees, commits, references, branches, ...
- Understanding these concepts helps to understand what the commands actually do!

---

## What is Git?

- Git is a **distributed** VCS: 
    - Does not rely on a server-client model.
    - Instead, everyone has a full copy of the entire project (repository).
        - Complete history, metadata, etc.
    - People can work completely independently. 
    - An (optional) server is used only to distribute changes. 

---

### Why use Git?

- It is popular.
    - Many project already use it, people know how to use it, people can tell you how to use it, ...
- Relies on hash sums: 
    - Built-in data corruption detection.
    - Built-in security.
- Distributed.
- Fast, simple and flexible.
- Free and open-source.

---

## How does Git store the history?

---

### What is inside a repository?

```shell
$ mkdir repository && cd repository
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in .../repository/.git/
$ find
```

```mermaid
graph TD
  A(["repository/"]) 
  B([".git/"])
  A --> B
  B --> C(["branches/"])
  B --> D(["hooks/"])
  B --> E(["info/ "])
  B --> F(["objects/"])
  B --> G(["refs/"])
  B --> H(["config"])
  B --> I(["description"])
  B --> J(["HEAD"])
  F --> K(["info/"])
  F --> L(["pack/"])
  G --> M(["heads/"])
  G --> N(["tags/"])
  
```

---

Most directories are empty and the files are not that interesting:

```shell
$ cat .git/config 
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
$ cat .git/HEAD 
ref: refs/heads/master
$ cat .git/description 
Unnamed repository; edit this file 'description' to name the
repository.
```

---

Let's add some content:

```shell
$ echo "This file is very interesting" > file.txt
$ git add file.txt
$ git commit -m "This is the first commit"
[master (root-commit) 23b3ed5] This is the first commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 file.txt
$ find
```

```mermaid
graph TD 
  A(["repository/"])
  B(["file.txt"]) 
  style B color:#FF0000
  C([".git/"])
  D(["logs/"]) 
  style D color:#FF0000

```

### Working tree

- Everything inside `repository/` is a part of the *working tree* (or the *workspace*).
    - `.git/` is not included.
    - At the moment, the working tree contains just one file, `file.txt`.
    - Working tree is just a regular directory.
- The `git add` and `git commit` commands tell Git to care about `file.txt`.
    - More on that later...

---

### Objects

- Git stores files etc as **objects**:
    - Objects are stored under `.git/objects/`.
- Git uses *content-based addressing*.
    - A *hash sum* is computed from the **content** of the object.
    - The hash "uniquely" identifies the object.
    - Two objects with identical contents have the same hash and are stored only once.

---

- We can compute the hash manually:

```shell
$ git hash-object file.txt
09c78e6e971ce9e3d69e75bcb3ffd5de05b0d59a
```

- We can find the corresponding object:

```shell
$ find
...
./.git/objects/09/c78e6e971ce9e3d69e75bcb3ffd5de05b0d59a
...
```

- We can confirm that two files with identical contents have the same hash:

```shell
$ cp file.txt file2.txt 
$ git hash-object file.txt file2.txt
09c78e6e971ce9e3d69e75bcb3ffd5de05b0d59a
09c78e6e971ce9e3d69e75bcb3ffd5de05b0d59a
```

---

- Note that we do not have to use the entire hash:

```shell
git cat-file -p 09c78e6e
This file is very interesting
```

- We only need to use as many characters as is required to uniquely identify the object.
    - 7-8 is enough in most cases.
    - 12 in larger projects.
- If more characters is required, an error message is printed.

---

- Objects cannot (and should not) be accessed directly:

```shell
$ hexdump -C ./.git/objects/09/c78e6e97*
00000000  78 01 4b ca c9 4f 52 30  ....  |x.K..OR06`...,VH|
00000010  cb cc 49 55 00 d2 65 a9  ....  |..IU..e.E...y%.E|
00000020  a9 c5 25 99 79 e9 5c 00  ....  |..%.y.\..I.3|
0000002c
```

- However, we can observe the type and the content of an object:

```shell
$ git cat-file -t 09c78e6e
blob
$ git cat-file -p 09c78e6e
This file is very interesting
```

---

- It is also important to realize that the object stays even when the file is removed:

```shell
$ rm file.txt
$ find
....
./.git/objects/09/c78e6e971ce9e3d69e75bcb3ffd5de05b0d59a
....
$ git cat-file -p 09c78e6e971ce9e3d69e75bcb3ffd5de05b0d59a
This file is very interesting
```

- We can restore the file from the object:

```shell
$ git restore file.txt
$ cat file.txt 
This file is very interesting
```

---

Let's take a second look at the repository:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A(["repository/"])
  B(["file.txt"])
  C([".git/"])
  D(["logs/"])
  E(["COMMIT_EDITMSG"])
  F(["index"])
  G(["branches/"])
  H(["hooks/"])
  I(["objects/"])
  J(["refs/"])
  K(["config"])
  L(["description"])
  M(["HEAD"])
  N(["info/ "])
  O(["23"])
  P(["1a"])
  Q(["09"])
  R(["info/ "])
  S(["pack/"])
  T(["heads/"])
  U(["tags/"])
  V(["b3ed5b16..."])
  style V color:#FF0000
  W(["098a06bf..."])
  style W color:#FF0000
  X(["c78e6e97..."])
  Y(["master"])

  A --> B
  A --> C
  C --> D
  C --> E
  C --> F
  C --> G
  C --> H
  C --> I
  C --> J
  C --> K
  C --> L
  C --> M
  C --> N
  I --> O
  I --> P
  I --> Q
  I --> R
  I --> S
  J --> T
  J --> U
  O --> V
  P --> W
  Q --> X
  T --> Y
```

*What are these two other objects?*

---

### Trees

- Let's investigate one of the remaining objects:

```shell
$ git cat-file -t 1a098a06
tree
$ git cat-file -p 1a098a06
100644 blob 09c78e6e971ce9e3d69e75b....    file.txt
```

- We can see that the type of the object is **tree**:
    - A tree stores pointers to
        - files (blobs) and 
        - other trees,
    - Trees are used to represent directory structures.

---

In this case, the tree has one level and one blob:

```mermaid
graph TD
  first_blob["blob 09c78e6e...<br>This file is very interesting"]

  tree(["tree 1a098a06b...<br>blob 09c78e6e.... file.txt"]) --> first_blob
```

---

Let's take a third look at the repository:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A(["repository/"])
  B(["file.txt"])
  C([".git/"])
  D(["logs/"])
  E(["COMMIT_EDITMSG"])
  F(["index"])
  G(["branches/"])
  H(["hooks/"])
  I(["objects/"])
  J(["refs/"])
  K(["config"])
  L(["description"])
  M(["HEAD"])
  N(["info/ "])
  O(["23"])
  P(["1a"])
  Q(["09"])
  R(["info/ "])
  S(["pack/"])
  T(["heads/"])
  U(["tags/"])
  V(["b3ed5b16..."])
  style V color:#FF0000
  W(["098a06bf..."])
  X(["c78e6e97..."])
  Y(["master"])

  A --> B
  A --> C
  C --> D
  C --> E
  C --> F
  C --> G
  C --> H
  C --> I
  C --> J
  C --> K
  C --> L
  C --> M
  C --> N
  I --> O
  I --> P
  I --> Q
  I --> R
  I --> S
  J --> T
  J --> U
  O --> V
  P --> W
  Q --> X
  T --> Y
```

*Just one object remains...*

---

### Commits

- Let's investigate the last object:

```shell
$ git cat-file -t 23b3ed5b
commit
$ git cat-file -p 23b3ed5b
tree 1a098a06bf0bcae9695238d9d5cb96345c00cacf
author Mirko Myllykoski <....@gmail.com> 1600867851 +0200
committer Mirko Myllykoski <....@gmail.com> 1600867851 +0200

This is the first commit
```

- The type of the object is **commit**. It contains 
    - a pointer to a tree, 
    - an author and a committer (+time), and 
    - a commit message 

---

A commit stores the state of the project in a given point of time.

---

In this case, the commit points to a tree that has one level and one blob:

```mermaid
graph TD
  first_blob["blob 09c78e6e...<br>This file is very interesting"]
  file["file.txt<br>This file is very interesting"]

  commit(["commit 23b3ed5b1...<br>tree 1a098a06b<br>Mirko Myll...<br>This is the first commit"]) --> tree(["tree 1a098a06b...<br>blob 09c78e6e.... file.txt"]) --> first_blob
  
  metadata(["metadata"]) --> repo(["repository/"]) --> file
```

---

In a more general case, the associated tree can contain **several** levels and **multiple** blobs:

```mermaid
graph TD
  file1["file1.txt"]
  file2["file2.txt"]
  file3["file3.txt"]
  file4["file4.txt"]

  blob1["blob 1"]
  blob2["blob 2"]
  blob3["blob 3"]
  blob4["blob 4"]

  commit1(["commit 1"]) --> tree1(["tree 1"])
  tree1 --> blob1
  tree1 --> blob2
  tree1 --> tree2(["tree 2"])
  tree2 --> blob3
  tree2 --> blob4
  
  metadata(["metadata"]) --> repo(["repository/"])
  repo --> file1
  repo --> file2
  repo --> dir(["directory/"])
  dir --> file3
  dir --> file4
```

---

## Working with Git

---

Let's see what else we can find...

```mermaid
graph TD
  A(["repository/"])
  B(["file.txt"])
  C([".git/"])
  D(["logs/"])
  E(["COMMIT_EDITMSG"])
  F(["index"])
  G(["branches/"])
  H(["hooks/"])
  I(["objects/"])
  J(["refs/"])
  style J color:#FF0000
  K(["config"])
  L(["description"])
  M(["HEAD"])
  style M color:#FF0000
  N(["info/ "])
  O(["23"])
  P(["1a"])
  Q(["09"])
  R(["info/ "])
  S(["pack/"])
  T(["heads/"])
  style T color:#FF0000
  U(["tags/"])
  V(["b3ed5b16..."])
  W(["098a06bf..."])
  X(["c78e6e97..."])
  Y(["master"])
  style Y color:#FF0000

  A --> B
  A --> C
  C --> D
  C --> E
  C --> F
  C --> G
  C --> H
  C --> I
  C --> J
  C --> K
  C --> L
  C --> M
  C --> N
  I --> O
  I --> P
  I --> Q
  I --> R
  I --> S
  J --> T
  J --> U
  O --> V
  P --> W
  Q --> X
  T --> Y
```

---

### HEAD and other references

- `HEAD` points (indirectly) to `23b3ed5b1`:

```shell
$ cat ./.git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
$ cat .git/refs/heads/master
23b3ed5b16095bb84b18d06734fdd614c8982841
```

```mermaid
graph LR
  
  head["HEAD"]
  style head fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  master["master"]
  style master fill:#ffffff, stroke:#ffffff
  
  first_blob["blob 09c78e6e...<br>This file is very interesting"]
  
  head --> master --> commit(["commit<br>23b3ed5b1..."]) --> tree(["tree<br>1a098a06b..."]) --> first_blob
```

---

- `HEAD` and `master` are **references**.
    - A reference points to commits and another reference.
- `HEAD` determines "most recent" commit.
    - Many commands **act on the current `HEAD`**. 
    - More on this later
- `master` is the current branch (more later). 

---

- You can create a reference yourself: 

```shell
$ git tag first
$ find
```

```mermaid
graph TD
  A(["repository/"])
  B(["file.txt"])
  C([".git/"])
  D(["logs/"])
  E(["COMMIT_EDITMSG"])
  F(["index"])
  G(["branches/"])
  H(["hooks/"])
  I(["objects/"])
  J(["refs/"])
  style J color:#FF0000
  K(["config"])
  L(["description"])
  M(["HEAD"])
  N(["info/ "])
  O(["23"])
  P(["1a"])
  Q(["09"])
  R(["info/ "])
  S(["pack/"])
  T(["heads/"])
  U(["tags/"])
  style U color:#FF0000
  V(["b3ed5b16..."])
  W(["098a06bf..."])
  X(["c78e6e97..."])
  Y(["master"])
  Z(["first"])
  style Z color:#FF0000

  A --> B
  A --> C
  C --> D
  C --> E
  C --> F
  C --> G
  C --> H
  C --> I
  C --> J
  C --> K
  C --> L
  C --> M
  C --> N
  I --> O
  I --> P
  I --> Q
  I --> R
  I --> S
  J --> T
  J --> U
  O --> V
  P --> W
  Q --> X
  T --> Y
  U --> Z
```

```shell
$ git rev-parse first
23b3ed5b16095bb84b18d06734fdd614c8982841
```

```mermaid
graph LR
  
  first["first"]
  style first fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  
  first_blob["blob 09c78e6e...<br>This file is very interesting"]
  
  first --> commit(["commit<br>23b3ed5b1..."]) --> tree(["tree<br>1a098a06b..."]) --> first_blob
```

---

### Index (staging area)

Let's repeat some of the earlier steps:

```shell
$ echo "More content" >> file.txt
$ git add file.txt
$ find
```

```mermaid
graph TD
  A(["repository/"])
  B(["file.txt"])
  style B color:#FF0000
  C([".git/"])
  D(["logs/"])
  E(["COMMIT_EDITMSG"])
  F(["index"])
  G(["branches/"])
  H(["hooks/"])
  I(["objects/"])
  J(["refs/"])
  K(["config"])
  L(["description"])
  M(["HEAD"])
  N(["info/ "])
  O(["23"])
  P(["1a"])
  Q(["09"])
  QR(["3b"])
  style QR color:#FF0000
  R(["info/ "])
  S(["pack/"])
  T(["heads/"])
  U(["tags/"])
  V(["b3ed5b16..."])
  W(["098a06bf..."])
  X(["c78e6e97..."])
  XY(["23ff0c41..."])
  style XY color:#FF0000
  Y(["master"])
  Z(["first"])

  A --> B
  A --> C
  C --> D
  C --> E
  C --> F
  C --> G
  C --> H
  C --> I
  C --> J
  C --> K
  C --> L
  C --> M
  C --> N
  I --> O
  I --> P
  I --> Q
  I --> QR
  I --> R
  I --> S
  J --> T
  J --> U
  O --> V
  P --> W
  Q --> X
  QR --> XY
  T --> Y
  U --> Z
```

```shell
$ git cat-file -p 3b23ff0c
This file is very interesting
More content
```

---

- The `git add` command creates a blob that correspond to the update `file.txt` file.
    - No other object are created yet.
- The command also adds the file to the **index**.
- The index will become the **next commit**.
    - Contains a representation of the tree object.

---

The index is a binary file:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A(["repository/"])
  B(["file.txt"])
  C([".git/"])
  D(["logs/"])
  E(["COMMIT_EDITMSG"])
  F(["index"])
  style F color:#FF0000
  G(["branches/"])
  H(["hooks/"])
  I(["objects/"])
  J(["refs/"])
  K(["config"])
  L(["description"])
  M(["HEAD"])
  N(["info/ "])
  O(["23"])
  P(["1a"])
  Q(["09"])
  QR(["3b"])
  R(["info/ "])
  S(["pack/"])
  T(["heads/"])
  U(["tags/"])
  V(["b3ed5b16..."])
  W(["098a06bf..."])
  X(["c78e6e97..."])
  XY(["23ff0c41..."])
  Y(["master"])
  Z(["first"])

  A --> B
  A --> C
  C --> D
  C --> E
  C --> F
  C --> G
  C --> H
  C --> I
  C --> J
  C --> K
  C --> L
  C --> M
  C --> N
  I --> O
  I --> P
  I --> Q
  I --> QR
  I --> R
  I --> S
  J --> T
  J --> U
  O --> V
  P --> W
  Q --> X
  QR --> XY
  T --> Y
  U --> Z
```

---

We can now turn the index to the next commit:

```shell
$ git commit -m "This is the second commit"
[master d3c6c63] This is the second commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
$ find
```

```mermaid
graph TD
  A(["repository/"])
  B(["file.txt"])
  C([".git/"])
  D(["logs/"])
  E(["COMMIT_EDITMSG"])
  F(["index"])
  G(["branches/"])
  H(["hooks/"])
  I(["objects/"])
  J(["refs/"])
  K(["config"])
  L(["description"])
  M(["HEAD"])
  N(["info/ "])
  O(["23"])
  P(["1a"])
  Q(["09"])
  QR(["3b"])
  QRR(["22/"])
  style QRR color:#FF0000
  QRRR(["d3/"])
  style QRRR color:#FF0000
  R(["info/ "])
  S(["pack/"])
  T(["heads/"])
  U(["tags/"])
  V(["b3ed5b16..."])
  W(["098a06bf..."])
  X(["c78e6e97..."])
  XY(["23ff0c41..."])
  XYY(["b5208beb..."])
  style XYY color:#FF0000
  XYYY(["c6c635fb..."])
  style XYYY color:#FF0000
  Y(["master"])
  Z(["first"])

  A --> B
  A --> C
  C --> D
  C --> E
  C --> F
  C --> G
  C --> H
  C --> I
  C --> J
  C --> K
  C --> L
  C --> M
  C --> N
  I --> O
  I --> P
  I --> Q
  I --> QR
  I --> QRR
  I --> QRRR
  I --> R
  I --> S
  J --> T
  J --> U
  O --> V
  P --> W
  Q --> X
  QR --> XY
  QRR --> XYY
  QRRR --> XYYY
  T --> Y
  U --> Z
```

---

 - Just as before, we have a tree object that describes the directory structure:

```shell
$ git cat-file -p 22b5208b
100644 blob 3b23ff0c411faf22c9253ed0....    file.txt
```

- And a commit, that describes the state of the repository:

```shell
$ git cat-file -p d3c6c635
tree 22b5208bebacfcf745691f799b08df492b2a7da9
parent 23b3ed5b16095bb84b18d06734fdd614c8982841
author Mirko Myllykoski <mirko...> 1601228824 +0200
committer Mirko Myllykoski <mirko....> 1601228824 +0200

This is the second commit
```

---

### Parent

- The major difference is that the commit contains a pointer to a **parent**:

```
parent 23b3ed5b16095bb84b18d06734fdd614c8982841
```

- The parent pointer points to the previous commit: 

```mermaid
graph LR
  secondcommit(["commit d3c6c635...<br>tree 22b5208b<br>parent 23b3ed5b1<br>Mirko Myll..<br>This is the second commit"]) --> firstcommit(["commit 23b3ed5b1...<br>tree 1a098a06b<br>Mirko Myll...<br>This is the first commit"]) --> tree2(["tree 1a098a06b...<br>blob 09c78e6e.... file.txt"]) 

  secondcommit --> tree1(["tree 22b5208b...<br>blob 3b23ff0c file.txt"])
  secondblob["blob 3b23ff0c<br>This file is very interesting<br>More content"]
  firstblob["blob 09c78e6e...<br>This file is very interesting"]
  
  tree2 --> firstblob
  tree1 --> secondblob
```

---

### Commit tree

- Usually, we have a complete tree of commits (**commit tree**):

```mermaid
graph LR
  commit1(["commit 1"]) --> tree1(["tree 1"])
  commit2(["commit 2"]) --> tree2(["tree 2"])
  commit2 --> commit1
  commit3(["commit 3"]) --> tree3(["tree 3"])
  commit3 --> commit2
  commit4(["commit 4"]) --> tree4(["tree 4"])
  commit4 --> commit3
```

- Each commit represents the state of the repository at a given point of time.

---

- Each commit is allowed to have **multiple** parents:

```mermaid
graph LR
  commit2(["commit 2"]) --> commit1(["commit 1"])
  commit4(["commit 4"]) --> commit3(["commit 3"])
  commit4 --> commit2
```

- These parents appear when two (or more) *branches* are **merged**.
    - More on this later...

---

### HEAD and other references (again)

- Let's investigate `HEAD` and `master`:

```shell
$ cat .git/HEAD 
ref: refs/heads/master
$ cat .git/refs/heads/master
d3c6c635fb44c7084797d47050bff7961853c19b
```

```mermaid
graph LR
  
  head["HEAD"]
  style head fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  master["master"]
  style master fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  
  head --> master --> secondcommit(["commit d3c6c635...<br>tree 22b5208b<br>parent 23b3ed5b1<br>Mirko Myll..<br>This is the second commit"]) --> firstcommit(["commit 23b3ed5b1...<br>tree 1a098a06b<br>Mirko Myll...<br>This is the first commit"])
  
  subgraph clusterworkingtree["Working tree"]
    clusterfile["file.txt<br><br>This file is very interesting<br>More content"]
  end
```

- Remember, many Git commands act on the current `HEAD`.

---

- We can change the `HEAD` to something else:

```shell
$ git checkout 23b3ed5b
....
HEAD is now at 23b3ed5 This is the first commit
$ cat .git/HEAD 
23b3ed5b16095bb84b18d06734fdd614c8982841
$ cat file.txt 
This file is very interesting
```

```mermaid
graph LR
  
  head["HEAD"]
  style head fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  master["master"]
  style master fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  
  master --> second_commit(["commit d3c6c635...<br>tree 22b5208b<br>parent 23b3ed5b1<br>Mirko Myll..<br>This is the second commit"]) --> first_commit(["commit 23b3ed5b1...<br>tree 1a098a06b<br>Mirko Myll...<br>This is the first commit"])
  
  head --> first_commit 
  
  subgraph cluster_working_tree["Working tree"]
    cluster_file["file.txt<br><br>This file is very interesting"]
  end
```

---

### Branches

- We can modify the working tree and create a new commit:

```shell
$ echo "Different content" >> file.txt 
$ git commit -a -m "This is the third commit"
[detached HEAD a118ae8] This is the third commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

- Let's investigate the newly created commit:

```shell
$ git cat-file -p a118ae8c
tree 5fcc4f83fedf5a94cd773704bdb1ab2cdcadc6fd
parent 23b3ed5b16095bb84b18d06734fdd614c8982841
author Mirko Myllykoski <mirko....> 1601286412 +0200
committer Mirko Myllykoski <mirko....> 1601286412 +0200

This is the third commit
```

---

- First, the `parent` points to the **first commit**:

```mermaid
graph LR
  
  third_commit(["commit a118ae8c...<br>parent 23b3ed5b1...<br>This is the third commit"]) --> first_commit(["commit 23b3ed5b1...<br>This is the first commit"]) 
```

---

- Second, the commit tree now has **two** branches: 

```mermaid
graph LR
  
  head["HEAD"]
  style head fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  master["master"]
  style master fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  
  third_blob["blob ea5f4b8e<br>This file is very interesting<br>Different content"]
  second_blob["blob 3b23ff0c<br>This file is very interesting<br>More content"]
  first_blob["blob 09c78e6e...<br>This file is very interesting"]

  head --> third_commit(["commit a118ae8c...<br>This is the third commit"]) -.-> third_blob 
  master --> second_commit(["commit d3c6c635...<br>This is the second commit"]) --> first_commit(["commit 23b3ed5b1...<br>This is the first commit"])
  
  third_commit --> first_commit
  second_commit -.-> second_blob  
  first_commit -.-> first_blob

  subgraph cluster_working_tree["Working tree"]
    cluster_file["file.txt<br><br>This file is very interesting<br>Different content"]
  end
```

---

We can give the second branch a **name**:

```shell
$ git checkout -b second_branch
Switched to a new branch 'second_branch'
$ cat .git/HEAD 
ref: refs/heads/second_branch
$ cat .git/refs/heads/second_branch
a118ae8cda10a8f0a966ab7b9158b4a6d3b48cfc
```

```mermaid
graph LR
  
  head["HEAD"]
  style head fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  master["master"]
  style master fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  second_branch["second_branch"]
  style second_branch fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  
  second_branch --> third_commit(["commit a118ae8c...<br>This is the third commit"]) -.-> third_blob["blob ea5f4b8e<br>This file is very interesting<br>Different content"] 
  second_commit(["commit d3c6c635...<br>This is the second commit"])
  first_commit(["commit 23b3ed5b1...<br>This is the first commit"])
  
  second_blob["blob 3b23ff0c<br>This file is very interesting<br>More content"]
  first_blob["blob 09c78e6e...<br>This file is very interesting"]
  
  second_commit -.-> second_blob
  first_commit -.-> first_blob
  
  third_commit --> first_commit
  second_commit --> first_commit
  
  head --> third_commit
  master --> second_commit
  
  subgraph cluster_working_tree["Working tree"]
    cluster_file["file.txt<br><br>This file is very interesting<br>Different content"]
  end
```

---

### Merging

We can **merge** the two branches together:

```shell
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --no-ff second_branch
Auto-merging file.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the
result.
$ vim file.txt
```

We fix some **conflicts** at this point...

```shell
$ git add file.txt
$ git merge --continue
[master f0d7298] Merge branch 'second_branch'
```

---

The created commit has **two** parents:

```shell
$ git cat-file -p f0d72989
tree f63f3a4c548f5065cee598bed4ae189bd2c099d8
parent d3c6c635fb44c7084797d47050bff7961853c19b
parent a118ae8cda10a8f0a966ab7b9158b4a6d3b48cfc
author Mirko Myllykoski <mirko....> 1601288485 +0200
committer Mirko Myllykoski <mirko....> 1601288485 +0200

Merge branch 'second_branch'
```

---

Finally, the tree looks like follows:

```mermaid
graph LR

    subgraph cluster_working_tree["Working tree"]
        cluster_file["file.txt<br><br>This file is very interesting<br>More content<br>Different content"]
    end
```

```mermaid
graph LR
  
  head["HEAD"]
  style head fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  master["master"]
  style master fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  second_branch["second_branch"]
  style second_branch fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff

  fourth_commit(["commit f0d72989...<br>Merge branch 'second_branch'"])
  third_commit(["commit a118ae8c...<br>This is the third commit"])
  second_commit(["commit d3c6c635...<br>This is the second commit"])
  first_commit(["commit 23b3ed5b1...<br>This is the first commit"])
  
  fourth_blob["blob e51364b9<br>This file is very interesting<br>More content<br>Different content"]
  third_blob["blob ea5f4b8e<br>This file is very interesting<br>Different content"]
  second_blob["blob 3b23ff0c<br>This file is very interesting<br>More content"]
  first_blob["blob 09c78e6e...<br>This file is very interesting"]
  
  fourth_commit -.-> fourth_blob
  third_commit -.-> third_blob 
  second_commit -.-> second_blob
  first_commit -.-> first_blob
  
  fourth_commit --> second_commit
  fourth_commit --> third_commit
  third_commit --> first_commit
  second_commit --> first_commit
  
  head --> fourth_commit
  master --> fourth_commit
  second_branch --> third_commit
```

---

### Switching to a specific commit

We can always move back to any of the previous commits:

```shell
$ git checkout 23b3ed5b1
....
HEAD is now at 23b3ed5 This is the first commit
$ cat file.txt 
This file is very interesting
```

```mermaid
graph LR

  head["HEAD"]
  style head fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  master["master"]
  style master fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff
  second_branch["second_branch"]
  style second_branch fill:#ffffff,stroke:#ffffff

  fourth_commit(["commit f0d72989...<br>Merge branch 'second_branch'"])
  third_commit(["commit a118ae8c...<br>This is the third commit"])
  second_commit(["commit d3c6c635...<br>This is the second commit"])
  first_commit(["commit 23b3ed5b1...<br>This is the first commit"])

  fourth_blob["blob e51364b9<br>This file is very interesting<br>More content<br>Different content"]
  third_blob["blob ea5f4b8e<br>This file is very interesting<br>Different content"]
  second_blob["blob 3b23ff0c<br>This file is very interesting<br>More content"]
  first_blob["blob 09c78e6e...<br>This file is very interesting"]

  fourth_commit -.-> fourth_blob
  third_commit -.-> third_blob
  second_commit -.-> second_blob
  first_commit -.-> first_blob

  fourth_commit --> second_commit
  fourth_commit --> third_commit
  third_commit --> first_commit
  second_commit --> first_commit

  head --> first_commit
  master --> fourth_commit
  second_branch --> third_commit
```

---

The end.

An idea: Try to play with the different commands. See what happens to the `.git/` directory.
