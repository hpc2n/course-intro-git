# Introduction to Git

This course will be an introduction to version control, with a strong focus on Git.

Instructors: 
<!--* Mirko Myllykoski (CS and HPC2N)-->
* Pedro Ojeda-May (HPC2N)
* Birgitte Brydsö (HPC2N)
* Diana Iusan (UPPMAX)
<!--* Björn Claremar (UPPMAX)-->

The course will have a mixture of lectures and hands-ons, and will be split into modules. It will consist of five half-days. 

---

* The lectures will be done in the main Zoom room. 
* Most modules will have hands-ons. These are done in the main Zoom room, but with the possibility to go to break-out rooms for help. There will also be a silent room for those who prefer to work undisturbed. 
* Some hands-ons will be done locally on your own computer and some will be done using GitHub. 
* If there is a problem using your own computer, the backup solution is logging in to Tetralith and using that (if you have an account). 
* The hands-ons for the module named "Teamwork" will be done in small groups, using GitHub. 

---

* During the hands-ons you can just ask the instructors if there is anything you need help with. 
* You can ask in the chat, but the recommended option is using the Questions and Answers page (Q&A page). The link can be found on the "Important information" page. 
* Please write any questions you have during the lectures etc. to the Q&A page. The instructors will try to answer as quickly as possible. 
* Scroll down on a slide page to get to access the slides in a text form (small pen icon)
