# Exercises - Working with remotes 

In order to do these exercises, you need to download the exercises zip file (if you already did so for the previous exercise, you do not need to do so again, of course).

You can do that either by cloning the repository or by just getting the zip file with `wget`.

- Do ONE of the following:
    - **git clone**
        1. `git clone https://github.com/hpc2n/course-intro-git.git`
        2. `cd course-intro-git`
        3. `unzip git_materials.zip`
        4. `cd git_materials`
        5. `cd 6.remotes`
    - **Fetch with wget**
        1. `wget https://github.com/hpc2n/course-intro-git/raw/refs/heads/main/git_materials.zip`
        2. `unzip git_materials.zip`
        3. `cd git_materials`
        4. `cd 6.remotes`

You are now in a directory with 2 subdirectories, one for each exercise.
