# Amending previous commit

The goal of this exercise is to learn to amend the latest commit. Enter the
`repository/` directory and perform the following steps:

 1. The ingredient list in the `repository/recipe.txt` file is missing an
    ingredient. Add two eggs to the ingredient list.

 2. Stage the changes and amend the previous commit
    (`Add remaining ingredients and directions`).

 3. Validate the operation. The log (`git log`) should contain three commits and
    the most recent commit (`Add remaining ingredients and directions`) should
    contain the new added ingredient (`git show <commit>`).
