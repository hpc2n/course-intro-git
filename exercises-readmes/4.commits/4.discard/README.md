# Discarding the latest commit

The goal of this exercise is to learn to discard the latest commit. Enter the
`repository/` directory and perform the following steps:

 1. Discard the latest commit. Also discard the changes in the working tree.
 
 2. Confirm that the commit is no longer reachable from `master`. Confirm that
    the `recipe.txt` no longer contains the section "Other ideas and hints".
 
 3. Try to restore the discarded commit. (optional)
