# Stashing uncommitted changes

The goal of this exercise is to learn to checkout a different commit and stash
uncommited changes, if necessary. Enter the `repository/` directory and perform
the following steps:

 1. Identify the first commit (`This is going to be a cake recipe`).
 
 2. Try to checkout the commit in order to identify the initial title of the
    recipe. If necessary, stash the changes. What was the initial title of the
    recipe?

 3. Restore the `HEAD` and pop the changes from the stash.
 
 4. Confirm that the changes were applied correctly and that the stash is empty.
