# Investigating the commit history

The goal of this exercise is to learn to use the `git log` command. Enter the
`repository/` directory and perform the following steps:

 1. Investigate the history. How many commit does the `main` branch contain?
 
 2. Can you make the output of the command cleaner?
 
 3. Are there any other branches? How many? What are they called?
 
 4. Try to filter the output so that only commits that contain the word
    "abandon" in the commit message are shown.

 5. Does the reference log contain anything interesting? Can you see where the 
    `HEAD` was 6 steps ago?

Hints:

 - oneline
 - graph
 - reflog
