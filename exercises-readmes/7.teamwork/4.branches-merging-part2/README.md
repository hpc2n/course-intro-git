# Branches and merging - continued

Immediate continuation of exercise 3. We are working on the repository and files. 

We are assuming you created your own branch and added stuff to it. Now we will merge that branch to the master branch. 

1. Go to the repository on the GitHub page. Submit a pull-request from your branch to the master branch 

2. The owner of the repository (the person who created it) can then accept them and click to merge them. 

3. After doing so, everyone should again do a `git pull`

4. Use `git status`, `git branch`, and `git log` to see what has happened.

5. If you want to, you can create more branches and try and merge them from the command line instead.
